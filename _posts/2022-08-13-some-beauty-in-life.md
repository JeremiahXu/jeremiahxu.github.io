<p>I&nbsp;am lately trying to take on coding again. It had always been a part of my life since my early years when I&nbsp;learned to program a Tandy Color Computer at the age of 8, the good old days.</p>

<p>Notice that since I am keeping an array of the coordinates of only the cells who are alive, I could apply just 3 rules, die of loneliness, die of overpopulation and become alive from reproduction (exactly 3 alive neighbors) because the ones who have 2 or 3 neighbors and are already alive, can remain alive in the next iteration.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;found it very interesting to implement the Game of Life like this, it was quite a refreshing challenge and I am beginning to feel my coding skills ramping up again.</p>
